							<p>Guru Rajalakshmi Krishna is the distinguished founder and principal of Shreebala Nrithyalaya Bharatanatyam School located in Frisco, Texas. Since initiating her teaching journey in the United States in 2015, she has been instrumental in promoting the rich traditions of Bharatanatyam. The school is renowned for its focus on nurturing students, both children and young adults, who are keen on mastering Bharatanatyam, particularly emphasizing the crucial aspects necessary for outstanding Margam presentations. This dedication has earned the school acclaim for its high standards and innovative choreography that stays true to the Vazhuvoor tradition.</p>
							<p>Guru Rajalakshmi’s students have had the honor of performing on various esteemed platforms across the United States and India. Their participation in significant events, including the Chennai Margazhi festival at reputable Sabhas and performances in well-known temples such as the Chidambaram and Kapaleeshwarar temples, stands testament to the school's prominence.</p>
							<p>Her journey in Bharatanatyam began under the tutelage of her grand-uncle, the legendary Natayacharya Kalaimamani K R Radhakrishnan, a maestro of the Vazhuvoor tradition. She started her training at the tender age of six with Guru Kalaimamani Thanjai Jayalakshmi Arunachalam Pillai, leading to her Arengetram in 1986. Her performances have not only been limited to prestigious Sabhas and temples across India and the USA but have also been featured on television, further showcasing her versatility and commitment to the art form.</p>
							<p>Academically, Guru Rajalakshmi Krishna has excelled in Bharatanatyam, securing a master's degree with distinction. Her academic prowess was highlighted when she was awarded a Gold Medal from The Madras Music College, a recognition of her outstanding achievements and contributions to the art of Bharatanatyam. She embarked on her teaching career in Chennai in 1994, where she has since developed numerous dance productions featuring music composed by her guru, K R Radhakrishnan.</p>
							<p><i>Through her roles as a teacher, composer, choreographer, and mentor, Guru Rajalakshmi Krishna continues to inspire and guide aspiring Bharatanatyam artists. Her commitment to the art form is evident in her efforts to cultivate the next generation of performers, ensuring the perpetuation and growth of Bharatanatyam as a GREAT ART.</i></p>
